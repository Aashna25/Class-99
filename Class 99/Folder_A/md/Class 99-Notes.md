● Import Python modules - os and shutil ● Use os and shutil module to create a file organizer program 

● Build a program which backs up all the files in a given folder

Do you remember what we learned in the last class?

We learned about functions. We also learned about functions defined for file object and use them to manipulate text inside files.

Remember the different libraries we used in javascript while designing games. Similar to Javascript, python has different libraries which have pre-written functions, objects etc. which we will start using in our class today.

Libraries in python are called Modules. We will learn how to import modules into our project and use them in programming. We will learn about two specific modules - os module and shutil module.

At the end of the class, we will have built two python tools which will automate - backing up any folder which we want. - organizing different kinds of files - images, videos, songs into separate folders

Do you know when you boot up your laptop/computer, it is actually running a program? Do you know what the program is called?

Operating System - Windows - Mac OS - Linux

Yes! Operating System. Our Operating system provides us with different functionalities like moving files, copying files etc. The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality. The functions that the OS module provides allows us to interface with the underlying operating system that Python runs on – be that Windows, Mac or. Linux.
